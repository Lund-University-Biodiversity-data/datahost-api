# Swagger generated server

## Overview
This server was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.  By using the [OpenAPI-Spec](https://github.com/OAI/OpenAPI-Specification) from a remote server, you can easily generate a server stub.

To view the Swagger UI interface:

```
open http://localhost:8080/docs
```

### Running the server
To run the server locally, run:

```
npm start
```

# production mode 
install pm2 to run background apps
```
sudo npm install pm2 -g
```

run one app in the background
```
pm2 --name datahost-api-server start npm -- start
```
list processes :
```
pm2 ps
```
kill one
```
pm2 delete 0
```



This project leverages the mega-awesome [swagger-tools](https://github.com/apigee-127/swagger-tools) middleware which does most all the work.
